    "Would you like to make any changes to the design or structure of the mind map? Here are some options you might consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Font and Size:** Adjust the base font size or change the font type.\n",
    "- **Color Scheme:** Modify the color gradient or use specific colors for different levels.\n",
    "- **Line Thickness:** Alter the base line thickness for connections between nodes.\n",
    "- **Node Size:** Change the base size of the nodes.\n",
    "- **Layout Style:** Switch the layout of the mind map (e.g., from circular to radial).\n",
